ActiveLinkHelper
================

A step closer to managing 'currenty selected links'

sample usage:
active_link 'Link', '/some_controller/and_action', :self_only
=> will be marked as active for that page only

active_link 'Link', '/some_controller/and_action', :self
=> will marked as active for that page and everything that goes after
=> so /some_controller/and_action/blah will also make it active

active_link 'Link', '/some_link', custom_regex
=> will be marked as active if regex matches current uri
