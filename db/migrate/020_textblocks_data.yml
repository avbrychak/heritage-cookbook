      We have a somewhat complex (but we think pretty good) layout engine. It takes your recipes and orders them in such a way that it maximizes the page space. So you don't needlessly pay for extra pages. Here how it works:

      

      p(help_1). As you know, your final recipe book will be ordered by sections (like chapters), you can drag and drop the ordering of these sections in the main recipe area (Navigation Tab #4).

      

      p(help_2). However, within a section, your recipes are laid out in a set order ? first come the two page recipes, then come the one page recipes, then come the half page recipes (which are combined automatically so that there are two to a page).

      

      p(help_3). Within each of these sub-orders (all of the one page recipes for example) the recipes are ordered alphabetically.

      

      p(help_4). We've added a new feature which allows you to 'force' a half page recipe to stay on it's own page, and not be combined with other half page recipes. To enable this, check the box at the bottom of the recipe edit page which says 'Separate recipe'. If you change your mind later and want it to combine with other half page recipes, uncheck the same box.

      h2. Adding and Managing Contributors

      

      This is where you can view, add, and delete contributors to your cookbook project. A contributor (once they have logged in) will be able to see all of the recipes in your cookbook, and will be able to add new recipes of their own, however they will not be able to edit any recipe other than their own.

      

      Click on 'Add Contributor' to add a new contributor.

      

      <div style="text-align:center"><img src="/images/help/contributor_detail.png" alt=""/></div>

      

      p(help_1). Enter the contributor's name and email information so that we can send them an invitation to join your cookbook team.

      

      p(help_2). Add a personalized note that will be included in the email invitation which they are sent.

      	<p>So, assuming you know the email address you had used on your account, simply enter that here, and you&#8217;ll be able to login.

      	<p><strong>Oh, there&#8217;s another catch.</strong> In this new system, passwords have to be at least 6 characters long. So, if your password from the previous system was shorter than that, we&#8217;ve simply added the letter &#8216;a&#8217; to the end, enough times to make it 6 characters long (e.g. if your password was &#8216;hi&#8217;, it now will be &#8216;hiaaaa&#8217;)</p>
