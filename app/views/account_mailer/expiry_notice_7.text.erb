Fundraising Success Story

"Everyone was just floored by the professionalism of the final published copy. I think that everyone was expecting something that was copied at Kinko's and hand bound. Instead, we got a cookbook that was professionally published in B&W and color on beautiful paper. The response was fantastic!"
