Reordering More Cookbooks
-------------------------

You can reorder at any time – it's easy.

If your membership is still live:
  
1. If you don't need to make any changes –
Just logon to order more books the way you did initially, and re-order your books from the "Books you've ordered" list. 
  
2. If you need to make a change to your book –
Opps – you forget to include Aunt Sally's chocolate chip cookie recipe 
in the first books? Just add her recipe and place your order.

If your membership has lapsed:
  
1. If you don't need to make any changes –
Just logon to your account. You go to the bottom of the page and click on the book that you wish to reorder. 
   
2. If you need to make a change to your book –
Oh, oh – you forgot Uncle Tom's special brew and he's pretty upset.
In this case you will need to reactivate your membership 
so that you can modify your book file to include his recipe. 
Then you place your order.

PS
The minimum order is still just four books.
Printing takes 2-3 weeks plus about a week for shipping.
