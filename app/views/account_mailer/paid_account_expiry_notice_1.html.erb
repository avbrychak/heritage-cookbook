<h2>Dear <%= @user_name %>,</h2>

<p>This is just a short reminder email to say that you have one day left before your HeritageCookbook membership expires.</p>

<p>If you need more time to finish your cookbook you can add it by logging on and clicking on Add More Time.</p>

<p>And if you need some help or have some questions please don't hesitate to email me.</p>

<p>These reminder emails come automatically even if you have already sent in your order. Not to worry. :)</p>

<p>
  Sincerely,
  <br/>
  Virginie
