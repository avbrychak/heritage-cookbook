You have 29 days left in your HeritageCookbook trial
----------------------------------------------------

Dear <%= @user_name %>,

I just wanted to check in with you and say "hello" and see how you are doing with your cookbook.   

Every few days or so during your free trial I'll send you a note with some fun quotes about food and some words from others who have also made cookbooks. I hope you enjoy what I found. I had fun putting it together.

Remember that if you have any questions and need any help just email me at <%= CONTACT_EMAIL %>.
