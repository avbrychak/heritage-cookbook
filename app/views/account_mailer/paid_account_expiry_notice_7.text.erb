Your HeritageCookbook account will expire in one week
-----------------------------------------------------

Dear <%= @user_name %>,

This is just a short reminder email to say that you have 7 days before your HeritageCookbook membership expires.

If you need more time to finish your cookbook you can add it by logging on and clicking on Add More Time.

These reminder emails come automatically even if you have already sent in your order. Not to worry. :)

And if you need some help or have some questions please email me at <%= CONTACT_EMAIL %>
