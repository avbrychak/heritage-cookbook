Dear <%= @user_name %>,

Just a few more fun quotes about food and some stories about people who have made a cookbook because sometimes we can all do with a little encouragement.

"The secret to staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age."
-- LUCILLE BALL, actress

"The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don’t want, drink what you don’t like, and do what you’d rather not."
-- MARK TWAIN, writer

What One Member likes about the site

"I love the fact that the online templates for the book are ready to work on step by step and if I’m not ready for one step I can always skip to the part of the book that I am ready to work on immediately. As the book unfolds, everything else seems to fall into place. I’m also addicted to the preview tab!"

Family Success Story

"I know I have created something my family is proud of because they told me that they had never received a better present."
