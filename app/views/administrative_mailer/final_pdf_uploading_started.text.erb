Good morning,

This is just an automated note to let you know that we've started PDF generation for the day. In the next few minutes, or maybe a bit longer, you should receive emails for the following <%= @orders.size %> orders:

<% @orders.each do |order| -%>

  Order #: <%= order.id %>-<%= order.version %>
  Cookbook #: <%= order.cookbook.id %>
  From: <%= order.bill_first_name %> <%= order.bill_last_name %> 
  Email: <%= order.bill_email %>
  Number ordered: <%= order.number_of_books %>

<% end -%>
